Codebase and code execution results (random seed 42) for SJ Choi et al.'s paper "Reframing Holographic Acoustic Tweezer Optimization: Force-Equilibrium and ε-Regularized Objectives for Rapid, Stable, and Robust Trapping"

The data in the paper may be reproduced using the following codebase, in computational environments recorded in: environment.yml

The main analysis file, Data_Analysis_Whole_Paper.ipynb features code that produces all figure analysises in the paper. for execution, the image files included in the repository will be needed.

The .ipynb and .py files, "Appendix A. Frequency invariance.ipynb", "Appendix D. Optimizer Robustness.ipynb", "Robustness with respect to the evaluation point.py" correspond to the codebase of data in the paper sections, with the same title as their filenames.
